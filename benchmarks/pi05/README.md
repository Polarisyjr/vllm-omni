# π0.5 Benchmarks

Latency benchmarks for π0.5 (`lerobot/pi05_base`) serving, used for the measurements in [`recipes/lerobot/Pi05.md`](../../recipes/lerobot/Pi05.md).

| Script | Measures | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `e2e_latency_pi05.py` | Client E2E round trip over the OpenPI websocket: msgpack pack, send, engine, denoise, unpack. Reports p50/p95/min/max and the device memory peak sampled from `nvidia-smi`. | A running server |
| `bench_pi05.py` | Model-level `sample_actions` latency and output shape over a batch size × camera-view sweep, with no serving stack. Writes `pi05_sweep.csv` and `pi05_sweep.md`. | A GPU and the checkpoint |
| `bench_batch_pi05.py` | Stage profile of `sample_actions` in rounds of B requests: time per stage (prefix embedding, prefill, denoising) and the DCGM activity of each stage looped alone. Writes one JSON per chain and a Markdown report over them. | A GPU and the checkpoint; `dcgmi` for the activity columns |
| `bench_engine_overhead_pi05.py` | BS=1 latency of the layers in between: model-only and in-process pipeline in one clean process, then `Omni.generate` with the `uni` or `mp` executor. With `--trace-dir`, the per-request marks of `vllm_omni.utils.latency_trace`. | A GPU and the checkpoint |
| `run_engine_overhead_matrix.sh`, `report_engine_overhead_pi05.py` | The full matrix for one dtype (independent runs of every layer plus traced and untraced client E2E, for one or two source trees) and its tables: the four layers, their gaps on the same requests, and p50/p95 per engine segment. | A GPU and the checkpoint |

## Client E2E latency

Start a server with the recipe's command, then run the client per camera count.
It serves the optimized path in the deploy config's `float32`; pass `--enforce-eager` to the server for the eager baseline and `--dtype bfloat16` for bfloat16.

```bash
# optimized path (CUDA graphs + fused kernels)
vllm serve lerobot/pi05_base --omni --port 8000 --deploy-config vllm_omni/deploy/pi05.yaml --disable-log-stats
# eager baseline
vllm serve lerobot/pi05_base --omni --port 8000 --deploy-config vllm_omni/deploy/pi05.yaml --enforce-eager --disable-log-stats

python benchmarks/pi05/e2e_latency_pi05.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --views 3 --warmup 3 --iters 30 --out e2e.json
```

## Model-level latency

The script builds the model through `Pi05Pipeline`, as the server does, from the deploy config's `model_config`.
It runs the optimized path by default; pass `--enforce-eager` for the eager baseline and `--dtype bfloat16` for bfloat16.

```bash
# optimized path (CUDA graphs + fused kernels)
python benchmarks/pi05/bench_pi05.py --bs 1 --views 3 --warmup 5 --iters 30 --out pi05_bench/
# eager baseline
python benchmarks/pi05/bench_pi05.py --enforce-eager --bs 1 --views 3 --warmup 5 --iters 30 --out pi05_bench_eager/
```

## Experimental P0 options

The benchmark supports independent `--vision-precision` (`fp32`, `bf16_autocast`,
`selective_bf16`) and `--batch-cameras` / `--no-batch-cameras` options to the model
benchmark. The corresponding stage `custom_pipeline_args` keys are
`pi05_vision_precision` and `pi05_batch_cameras`; CLI values override them.
Defaults preserve R0's FP32 vision/projector and sequential cameras. Both BF16
experiments restore FP32 image features before the prefix LM, preserving R0's
prefix residual dtype. Selective BF16 retains FP32 patch/position embeddings;
autocast retains all FP32 vision/projector weights. Changing either precision or
camera batching can change rounding; action parity and task quality need to be
evaluated separately from latency.
The 1/2-camera cases retain three image slots with false masks for missing views.

Three independent runtime flags are also available, all disabled by default:
`--precompute-adarms` prepares the default denoising schedule's timestep/conditioning
projections after checkpoint load; `--hoist-denoise-invariants` computes mask,
position IDs, and RoPE once per request; `--prefix-kv-only` omits the final prefix
hidden-state work when action generation only consumes KV. Their stage
`custom_pipeline_args` keys are `pi05_precompute_adarms`,
`pi05_hoist_denoise_invariants`, and `pi05_prefix_kv_only`. Each flag also has a
`--no-...` form for ablation. General prefix forward keeps its full hidden output.

`--execution-mode eager|fused|graph` selects the implementation independently from
these numerical/algorithm settings. `--enforce-eager` remains an alias for eager;
combining it with fused/graph is an error. Default execution remains graph.

```bash
python benchmarks/pi05/bench_pi05.py --dtype bfloat16 --bs 1 --views 1 2 3 \
  --vision-precision selective_bf16 --batch-cameras --warmup 20 --iters 30 \
  --out pi05_p0_selective_batched/

# Full P0 candidate; use --no-<flag> for individual ablations, and compare the
# same options under --execution-mode eager / fused / graph.
python benchmarks/pi05/bench_pi05.py --dtype bfloat16 --bs 1 --views 1 2 3 \
  --vision-precision selective_bf16 --batch-cameras --precompute-adarms \
  --hoist-denoise-invariants --prefix-kv-only --execution-mode graph \
  --warmup 20 --iters 30 --out pi05_p0_all_on/
```

These are latency/finite-output checks, not a fixed-noise numerical parity gate.
Run each policy in a fresh process; correctness, capture/replay,
stage profiling, and task-level quality require separate validation. Compare
latency only at the same model/serving boundary, with matching inputs, denoising
steps, warmup, GPU, and precision policy.

## Stage profile

`bench_batch_pi05.py` times the three calls `sample_actions` makes, in place, for rounds of B requests, then
replays each stage alone so that the DCGM samples of a window belong to one stage. One run measures one chain
(`bfloat16` unless `--dtype` says otherwise); the report covers every chain file in the directory.

```bash
python benchmarks/pi05/bench_batch_pi05.py --mode eager --out pi05_stages/
python benchmarks/pi05/bench_batch_pi05.py --mode graph --out pi05_stages/
python benchmarks/pi05/bench_batch_pi05.py --mode graph --vision-precision selective_bf16 --all4 --out pi05_stages/
python benchmarks/pi05/bench_batch_pi05.py --report pi05_stages/ --out-md pi05_stages/report.md
```

`--all4` turns on the four opt-in runtime switches above. The optimized path captures the three regions for
batch sizes 1, the powers of two below the largest `--batches` value, and that value; a batch size between two
of them runs its prefix regions without a graph and its denoising step on the next larger graph. A batch size
the optimized path has no CUDA graph for is reported as such rather than timed on its eager fallback.

The report also sets every batch against the same requests run one at a time (B times the chain's batch-1
p50): req/s, speedup, scaling efficiency, the run's round-to-round spread and peak memory, per chain and
batch size. The matching correctness check is `tests/diffusion/models/pi05/test_pi05_batch_parity.py`: each
row of a formed batch against its request alone, and no cross-request contamination.

## Engine overhead

The time between the model and the client is attributed with an opt-in trace: with `VLLM_OMNI_LATENCY_TRACE_DIR` set, every process stamps each request at about 40 points on one clock, and the report sums consecutive stamps into segments.

```bash
# profile of the current tree: 3 runs per layer, 20 warmup + 200 timed requests per camera count
VARIANTS=after RUNS=3 WARMUP=20 ITERS=200 REQUESTS=200 bash benchmarks/pi05/run_engine_overhead_matrix.sh bf16 results/
